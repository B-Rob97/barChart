## Vulnerabilities

**Important Note:** This project is for learning purposes within a class environment. As such, it should be noted that the project contains identified vulnerabilities that have not been addressed or fixed. The decision not to resolve these vulnerabilities was made due to the limited scope and context of the project.

In a real-world production environment, it is crucial to address and resolve vulnerabilities to ensure the security and integrity of the application. However, for the purposes of this educational project, the focus is on learning the concepts and techniques of building a bar chart library using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Please keep in mind that this project should not be used in a production setting without first addressing the identified vulnerabilities and following best security practices.
